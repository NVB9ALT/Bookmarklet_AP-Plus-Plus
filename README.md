# Bookmarklet_AP-Plus-Plus

This is a bookmarklet version of AP++ for users who cannot use Chrome extensions for whatever reason. Currently it will just be AP++, however it may be expanded at some point to include FMC.

Note that this cannot simply be thrown into the console, as far as I am aware; it's too big at 7.6MB.
